The points refer strictly to commonly used label-related functionality. The package expss, in particular, has extensive functionality to convert SPSS tools into R. Furthermore, the list above is by no means exhaustive. Packages like foreign and readstata13 can read and write labeled data files. The package Hmisc has a function label() that gets/sets label attributes of an object. The four packages listed above, however, were all built specifically wih labeled data in mind, and thus they will be the focus of this book. You will also notice there is a lot of overlap in the functionality of these packages. While they often compliment each other, they can just as often step on each othersâ€™ toes. As such, I do not recommend loading all the packages whenever you want to work with labelled data in R. Rather, load the package you will rely on most (personal choice), then call specific functions from other packages as needed. This will help you keep track of which functions belong to which packages and make debugging your scripts much easier. 2 1+1 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
