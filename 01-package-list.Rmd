All these packages have more functionality than what has been listed here. The points refer strictly to commonly used label-related functionality. The package `expss`, in particular, has extensive functionality to convert SPSS tools into R. Furthermore, the list above is by no means exhaustive. Packages like `foreign` and `readstata13` can read and write labeled data files. The package `Hmisc` has a function `label()` that gets/sets label attributes of an object. The four packages listed above, however, were all built specifically wih labeled data in mind, and thus they will be the focus of this book.
